Located on Route 7 in New Milford, Rocky River Motel offers the class of an inn at the cost of a motel. We recently renovated all twenty of our old units and constructed a new building. Our facility provides single and double bedrooms and suites with amenities you would not normally find in a motel.
 
From hair dryers to video games, kitchens to Jacuzzis - Rocky River Motel has it all! You can fish in the river right behind our facility or get some exercise on our sports court. If it's peace and quiet you're looking for, nothing beats the comfort and luxury of a stay in one of our cozy rooms. You get all of this for only a fraction of the cost of those high-priced lodging alternatives.
 
Rocky River Motel is the place for the smart traveler with discriminating taste.
